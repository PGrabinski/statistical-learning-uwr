# Problems

## Problem 1
### 1. Let $Z_1, Z_2, ...$ be independent copies of a $N(0, 1)$ variable. Use these to define a chi-squared random variable with $p$ degrees of freedom $\chi^2_p$. Similarly, recall the definition of an $F$ distribution with $d_1$ and $d_2$ degrees of freedom $F_{d1,d2}$.

A chi-squared random variable $X$ with $p$ degrees of freedom can be defined as
$$X^2_p=\sum_{i=1}^p Z_i^2$$

Assuming that $p>=d_1+d_2$, a random variable $Y$ from the $F$ distribution with $d_1$ and $d_2$ degrees of freedom can be defined as:
$$Y=\frac{\frac{1}{d_1}\sum_{i=1}^{d_1}Z_i^2}{\frac{1}{d_2}\sum_{i=d_1+1}^{d_1+d_2}Z_i^2}$$

### 2.Consider a random variable distributed according to $F_{p,n-p}$. What distribution will $F_{p,n-p}$ approximately follow for $p=4$ and $n=1000$?
